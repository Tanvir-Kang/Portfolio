  Introduction: "My role at RFG can be split into three sets of responsibilities. I wore many hats, took on a variety of responsiblities which led into me carving a unique 'full-stack' role.",
  headingOne: "Front-End",
  DescriptionOne: "I worked in a React-Native application that was deployed on both the Apple AppStore and Google PlayStore. A few of the components I created were a privacy policy page in the sign up flow adhering to Apple & Google standards. \
  A stats controller page that recieved the incoming stats, parsing them into the correct unit, appending unit symbols, and displaying them in the correct percision. I gained working experience in Redux, Sagas, containers for dependency injection, event handling, \
  asynchronous functions, functional components, and states.",
  headingTwo: "Back-End",
  DescriptionTwo: "Along-side another senior server developer, I was working in an existing Java SpringBoot project that was microservice based. My primary duty was to create, update, or fix golf stats. \
    Based on feedback from the client  requesting a new stat or fixing another one was my responsibility. I met with the client to conduct requirement gathering sessions, and from there would discuss \
    the requirements with my lead and project manager. This was a particularly detailed role at times due to critical nature of accuracy for our client, I also discovered mutliple issues with stats data being sent from our simulator to the server causing multiple re-writes of stats calculations and unit tests. \
    When tickets were low I reduced the run-time complexity of multiple bottleneck functions, and reduced cognitive complexity of monolithic functions. ",
  headingThree: "QA",
  DescriptionThree: "I was responsible for the entire QA process of three different platforms, a golf simulator, a mobile app, and a server. I lead the creation of regression test plans for all three platforms, created deployment checklists, and faciliated \
    the creation of a formal bug ticket format, Jira QA flow, and communicating with our client to report bugs. I managed integeration testing between the products, being accountable for the accuracy of golf statistics. I was grateful for this experience for a variety of reasons; \
    it allowed me the opportunity to investigate, and resolve issues on three different platforms in three different languages. It also revealed the nuances with integrating multiple platforms. My dubugging toolset expanded by using breakpoints, dubuggers, automated API testing with Postman, \
    managing missed requirements, facilitating communication between dev teams. This eventually lead to me being the go-to for bug investigation and estimations for fixes.  ",
  toolsUsed: "Typescript, Java, C#, CSS, HTML, Git, SQL, React, React-Native, SpringBoot, Material-UI, Visual Studio, Unity, Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, PostMan, React-Native Debugger, Charles Proxy, SourceTree, Jira ",
  otherWorkExperience: "I have worked a fair amount of odd jobs in the past in-between school sessions here are a few: "
